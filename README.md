This repository contains my project on **automatic liver tumor segmentation** from CT scans using deep learning.  
The study compares **U-Net** and **ResNet50** architectures for accurate segmentation of liver tumors, leveraging  
loss functions like **Tversky Loss** and evaluation metrics such as **Dice Coefficient, Jaccard Index, and Accuracy**.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology
- **U-Net**: Encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections for precise boundary segmentation.  
- **ResNet50**: Pre-trained backbone adapted for segmentation tasks, fine-tuned for CT scans.  
- **Dataset**: Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) challenge dataset.  
- **Loss Function**: Tversky Loss to handle class imbalance.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Dice, Jaccard, and Accuracy.

## ðŸ“Š Results
| Model   | Dice Coefficient | Jaccard Index | Validation Accuracy |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **U-Net**   | 0.93            | 0.92          | 97.18%               |
| **ResNet50** | 0.94            | 0.94          | 97.15%               |

- U-Net: More efficient and lightweight, but misses very small tumors.  
- ResNet50: Stronger feature extraction, better precision for irregular tumors.
